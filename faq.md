Everything you ever wanted to know about this challenge (and some things you didn't want to know).

### General Questions
- When will the challenge take place? <br/> A. The challenge is scheduled to start at 9 am on December 30th, 2018 and complete at 9 am January 6th, 2019.
- Where will the challenge take place? <br/> A. At an undisclosed location in San Antonio TX.  It will be live-streamed for 20 hours each day.

The hours of sleep per night will increase from 4 to 6 hours.  If this happens, we will publish an extended schedule detailing the amounts that will go to charity.

### Financial Questions
- Why shouldn't I just give money directly to charity? <br/> A. You should! Give Directly to [The Habitat for Humanity of San Antonio](https://www.givedirect.org/donate/?cid=246) right now!

- Why did you pick The Habitat for Humanity of San Antonio? <br/> A. San Antonio is my home city, and I think the charity I chose does good for the city. I started my search broadly, and didn't have to go far to find the Habitat for Humanity. I narrowed my search to include only charities that had "perfect scores" according to [Charity Navigator.](https://www.charitynavigator.org/) There were three Habitat for Humanity charities on the list, out of 60 charities with perfect scores, and the one in San Antonio was one of those three. I looked into how they calculated the scores (you can acces the same information [here),](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=1287&print=1) and decided that I thought the charity would make great use of any donations. I also liked the fact that I could also volunteer my time at a charity so close to home, that does so much good for the community.

- I can't find a link to your GoFundMe page :( <br/> A. [Here you go!](https://www.gofundme.com/140-hour-movie-challenge)
