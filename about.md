## The Origins of the Challenge

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

On Sept 3, 2018, [/u/Caboucha](https://www.reddit.com/user/Caboucha) asked the following question on /r/AskReddit :

[You'll get $100.000 if you binge-watch the same movie for a week straight with only 4h sleep a night, what movie do you pick?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9cpe0d/youll_get_100000_if_you_bingewatch_the_same_movie/)

We are going to answer that question, but with a twist - YOU can pick the movie!

### Rules
<div class="box">
  <ol>
    <li>Breaks
      <ul>
        <li>One 25 minute shower/hygiene break every other day, starting on day 2.</li>
        <li>35 minutes total for bathroom breaks per day, only to be used for going to the bathroom. Time does not roll over.</li>
        <li>Food: No more than 25 minutes of prep time per day, meals will be eaten while watching movie.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Minimum volume level: Volume must never be below “10”.</li>
    <li>I can choose to sit or stand whenever I like. Or even to exercise.</li>
    <li>I cannot consume any other media, including social media, during the 7 day period. The only exception to this rule is interaction with people watching the stream, which will be limited to 9pm to 1am central time.</li>
    <li>Movie will be viewed beginning at the first preview, until the end of the credits for 140 hours. It will be stopped when the 20 hours for the day is up, and resumed when the next day starts.</li>
    <li>Other people can join me in person and watch the movie with me at their discretion.</li>
    <li>The performance will be live-streamed.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
  Other rules may be added as needed.  This is supposed to be very mentally and psychologically challenging. However, I want to be careful to avoid any dangerous or life-threatening complications.

### Financial Concerns
<div class="box">
  <ol>
    <li>My default charity is Habitat for Humanity in San Antonio Texas. Any money not tagged for another charity will go to that Habitat for Humanity of San Antonio. </li>
    <li>If any other charity is voted for with $2,000+ that charity will receive money at the same split as all other charities</li>
    <li>½ of my total profit (excluding exceptions mentioned above) up until the first day of movie watching will be donated to the Habitat for Humanity in San Antonio Texas, after I begin the challenge, 100% of any additional donations will go directly to the organization.</li>
    <li>Each $1 donated counts as a vote. Each donation will allow you to pick one charity and one movie. The minimum donation is $5</li>
    <li>Votes will be tracked by watching hasmarks on gofundme comments correlated to donations.  The last hashed comment you make will count as your vote and be applied to all your donations</li>
  </ol>
