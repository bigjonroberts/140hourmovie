## The Origins of the Challenge

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

On Sept 3, 2018, [/u/Caboucha](https://www.reddit.com/user/Caboucha) asked the following question on /r/AskReddit :

[You'll get $100.000 if you binge-watch the same movie for a week straight with only 4h sleep a night, what movie do you pick?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9cpe0d/youll_get_100000_if_you_bingewatch_the_same_movie/)

We are going to answer that question, but with a twist - YOU can pick the movie!

### Rules
<div class="box">
  <ol>
    <li>Breaks
      <ul>
        <li>One 25 minute shower/hygiene break every other day, starting on day 2.</li>
        <li>35 minutes total for bathroom breaks per day, only to be used for going to the bathroom. Time does not roll over.</li>
        <li>Food: No more than 25 minutes of prep time per day, meals will be eaten while watching movie.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Minimum volume level: Volume must never be below “10”.</li>
    <li>I can choose to sit or stand whenever I like. Or even to exercise.</li>
    <li>I cannot consume any other media, including social media, during the 7 day period. The only exception to this rule is interaction with people watching the stream, which will be limited to 9pm to 1am central time.</li>
    <li>Movie will be viewed beginning at the first preview, until the end of the credits for 140 hours. It will be stopped when the 20 hours for the day is up, and resumed when the next day starts.</li>
    <li>Other people can join me in person and watch the movie with me at their discretion.</li>
    <li>The performance will be live-streamed.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
  Other rules may be added as needed.  This is supposed to be very mentally and psychologically challenging. However, I want to be careful to avoid any dangerous or life-threatening complications.
  </p>

### Voting
<div class="box">
  <ol>
    <ui>	In short: $1 per vote with $5 minimum, votes are cast via hashtags in comments on the gofundme page, votes are cast for movie and for charity, I will watch the movie that has the most points as of 12/24/2018.
        
    <ui>	In long: Votes will be recorded for which movie I will watch, and for which charity you want to donate to. Votes cost $1 each, with a minimum donation of $5 for voting privileges, and will be recorded as points for any movie or charity. Votes will be cast via comments on gofundme, simply say what you want to say and leave a # to cast your vote. For example: if you were to donate ONE MILLION DOLLARS, your single comment would add a million points to the movie hashtagged in your comment, and a million points to the charity hashtagged in your comment. Example comment of example scenario: “Hey I hope you get to watch a movie you really enjoy! Keep up the good work you cute and funny fellow ;) #groundhogday #WoundedWarriorProject.” For this comment, one million points would go to the movie Groundhog Day, and one million points would to to the Wounded Warrior Project Charity. If for whatever reason you decide not to leave a comment, your movie points will go toward whichever movie is winning at the time of your donation, and your charity points will go to fund the Habitat for Humanity of San Antonio.
  </ol>

### Perks
<div class="box">
  <ol>
    <li>	$5+ You get points to enforce your will. Pick the movie you think I should have to endure, and pick your favorite charity.
    <li>	$69.420 - Nice, leave your email and I’ll send you a message.
    <li>	$70+ You get access to the chat within which I will interact with you folks every day from 9pm to 1am central time.
    <li>	Top donator for each day will have the opportunity to have me wear a shirt promoting a company of their choice, and I will read up to one page of a family friendly ad.
  </ol>
</div>

### Financial Concerns
<div class="box">
  <ol>
    <li>Charity point counts will be reset after each day is fully funded. Once that day is funded, I will donate 1 dollar for every 2 points to charities with 2,000+ points. If a charity has less than 2,000 points, their points will be counted toward the Habitat for Humanity of San Antonio. </li>
    <li>Fixed costs - It will cost me some money to buy a webcam, the movie, storage drive, backup generator, etc. and these costs will be taken out to purchase said items before any other distribution of money. This means that the split between myself and charity will be made after fixed costs are deducted. I will publish any spendings that count toward the fixed costs category.
</li>
    <li>The final day to put your points toward a movie will be December 24, 2018. After this day, only votes for charities will be counted. Donations will be accepted through the last day of the live stream, which will begin on December 30, 2018.
</li>
      <li>Where the money is going:
      <ul>
        <liCharity money - the money designated for charity distribution will be sent directly to the charities, upon the full funding of each day.
</li>
        <li>Josiah money - of the money I get out of this challenge, $30,000 will go to pay my current student loans, and to pay for the four remaining semesters I need to earn my bachelor’s degree. The remainder of the money I receive will go into several different places including but not limited to: various investments, a nice dinner with my family, gifts for my girlfriend, my gaming computer, into my bank account, folded up and shoved under my mattress, maybe a t-shirt or two.</li>
      </ul>
  </ol>
